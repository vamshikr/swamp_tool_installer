== Tool Invoke

A `tool-invoke` file is a template file containing a SWAMP tool's executable command.

Example for Flake8:
```<executable>
    --verbose
    --exit-zero
    --format=pylint
	--config="$VMINPUTDIR/flake8.config"
    <python-3-src% >
```

Non C/C++ Assessment frameworks in SWAMP has an program that takes the template file, along with a dictionary, and environment variables, and generates an executable command.

The first line in a tool invoke file is the path or name of the executable or a variable. Each line is an option or an argument.

The names enclosed in `<>` are variables and are looked up in the dictionary. If the variable is not in the dictionary, the option or argument is not added to the executable command.

If there is a `%` in the variable name (Example `<python-3-src% >`), the characters after `%` will be used as a separator provided the value for the key in the dictionary is a list.
