== Ruby Tools

=== Get Tool Bundles

Run the script `get_tool.sh` with _tool-type_ and _tool-version_ as arguments

Example:
```
./get_tool.sh reek 5.2.0
```

The above command creates `reek-5.2.0` directory and downloads gems for reek and its dependencies into it

=== Install Tool from gems
Change to the directory containing the `.gem` files and run the command:
```
gem install --no-document --user-install --local '*.gem'
```
